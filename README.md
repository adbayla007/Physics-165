# 📊 Statistical Analysis of Fatigue and Injury Risk in Athletes

This project analyzes the relationship between athlete fatigue and injury risk using real-world data. It is designed as a final requirement for a statistical physics course and demonstrates how basic probability concepts like Gaussian distribution can be applied to practical scenarios in sports science.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Athlete Injury and Performance Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/athlete-injury-and-performance-dataset)
- **Features Used**:
  - `Fatigue_Score`
  - `Injury_Indicator`
  - `Recovery_Days_Per_Week`
  - `Training_Intensity`, etc.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Google Colab (Python)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

## 📈 Methods
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Visualization of fatigue score distribution
3. Gaussian fit to fatigue scores
4. Boxplot analysis comparing injury vs non-injury groups
5. Interpretation of injury likelihood

## 📌 Key Findings
- Athletes who were injured had a significantly higher median fatigue score (~8) than those who weren’t (~5).
- The fatigue scores of injured athletes clustered tightly at the high end of the scale.
- Fatigue is a strong predictor of injury risk and should be monitored to prevent harm.
